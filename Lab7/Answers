1. Consider two medical tests, A and B, for a virus. Test A is 95% effective at
   recognizing the virus when it is present, but has a 10% false positive rate
   (indicating that the virus is present, when it is not). Test B is 90% effective
   at recognizing the virus, but has a 5% false positive rate. The two tests use
   independent methods of identifying the virus. The virus is carried by 1% of all
   people. Say that a person is tested for the virus using only one of the tests,
   and that test comes back positive for carrying the virus. Which test returning
   positive is more indicative of someone really carrying the virus? Justify your
   answer mathematically.

   Test A is 95% effective at recognizing the virus and has a 10% false positive rate.
   Test B is 90% effective at recognizing the virus and has a 5% false positive rate.
   The virus is carried by 1% of all people.

   For Test A:
   P(Virus) = 0.01 (Prior probability of having the virus)
   P(-Virus) = 0.99 (Prior probability of not having the virus)
   P(Positive|Virus) = 0.95 (Sensitivity or true positive rate)
   P(Positive|-Virus) = 0.1 (False positive rate)

   For Test B:
   P(Virus) = 0.01 (Prior probability of having the virus)
   P(-Virus) = 0.99 (Prior probability of not having the virus)
   P(Positive|Virus) = 0.90 (Sensitivity or true positive rate)
   P(Positive|-Virus) = 0.05 (False positive rate)

   P(Virus|Positive) = P(Positive|Virus) * P(Virus) / P(Positive) =>
   P(Virus|Positive) = (P(Positive|Virus) * P(Virus)) / (P(Positive|Virus) * P(Virus) + P(Positive|-Virus) * P(-Virus))

   Test A:
   0,95 * 0,01 / (0,95 * 0,01 + 0,1 * 0,99) = 0,09

   Test B:
   0,90 * 0,01 / (0,90 * 0,01 + 0,05 * 0,99) = 0,15

   Test B is more indicative of someone actually carrying the virus despite its lower sensitivity because it has a
   lower false positive rate, which significantly affects the PPV, especially when the prevalence of the virus is low
   (1%).

2. After your yearly checkup, the doctor has bad news and good news. The bad news is that
   you tested positive for a serious disease and that the test is 99% accurate (i.e., the
   probability of testing positive when you do have the disease is 0.99, as is the
   probability of testing negative when you don’t have the disease). The good news is that
   this is a rare disease, striking only 1 in 10,000 people of your age. Why is it good news
   that the disease is rare? What are the chances that you actually have the disease?

   When a disease is rare, the chances of being a false positive is greatly increased.
   We can use Bayes' Theorem to argue this statement:

   P(Positive|Disease) = 0.99
   P(Positive|-Disease) = 0.01
   P(Disease) = 1 / 10000 = 0.0001
   P(-Disease) = 1 - P(Disease) = 0,9999
   P(-Disease|Positive) = 0.01
   P(-Disease|Negative) = 0.99

   P(Disease|Positive) = P(Positive|Disease) * P(Disease) / P(Positive) =>
   P(Disease|Positive) = (P(Positive|Disease) * P(Disease)) / (P(Positive|Disease) * P(Disease) + P(Positive|-Disease) * P(-Disease))

   P(Disease|Positive) = (0,99 * 0,0001) / (0,99 * 0,0001 + 0,01 * 0,9999) = 0,0098
   This means the chances of having the disease are very low.

3. Would it be rational for an agent to hold the three beliefs P(A)=0.4, P(B)=0.3, and P(A∨B)=0.5? If so, what range of
   probabilities would be rational for the agent to hold for A∧B?

   We need to check if the given probabilities for P(A), P(B), and P(A∨B) are consistent with the axioms of probability.
   According to the addition rule of probabilities for any two events A and B:

   P(A∨B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A^B).
   P(A) = 0.4
   P(B) = 0.3
   P(A∨B) = 0.5

   We can rearrange the addition rule to solve for P(A∧B):
   P(A^B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∨B)
   P(A^B) = 0,4 + 0,3 - 0,5 = 0,2

   Since probabilities cannot be negative, and P(A∧B) cannot be greater than either P(A) or P(B), it would be rational
   for the agent to hold P(A∧B) in the range of [0, min(P(A), P(B))]. Given the values P(A) = 0.4 and P(B) = 0.3, the
   maximum possible value for P(A∧B) would be 0.3.

   In this case, it is rational for the agent to believe that P(A∧B) is 0.2, as it falls within the range of [0, 0.3].
   If P(A∧B) were outside of this range, the beliefs would be considered irrational because they would violate the
   axioms of probability.

4. Would it be rational for an agent to hold the three beliefs P(A)=0.4, P(B)=0.3, and P(A∨B)=0.7?
   What type of relationship holds between A and B?

   We need to check if the given probabilities for P(A), P(B), and P(A∨B) are consistent with the axioms of probability.
   According to the addition rule of probabilities for any two events A and B:

   P(A∨B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A^B).
   P(A) = 0.4
   P(B) = 0.3
   P(A∨B) = 0.7

   We can rearrange the addition rule to solve for P(A∧B):
   P(A^B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∨B)
   P(A^B) = 0,4 + 0,3 - 0,7 = 0

   Since P(A∧B) is 0, this implies that events A and B are mutually exclusive, which means they cannot both occur at
   the same time. This is rational, as P(A∨B) equals the sum of P(A) and P(B) directly, indicating that there is no
   overlap between A and B.

5. Given the full joint distribution shown below, calculate the following:
   |----------------|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
   |                |        toothache       |       ¬toothache       |
   |----------------|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
   |                |   catch    |  ¬catch   |   catch    |  ¬catch   |
   |----------------|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
   |     cavity     |   0.108    |   0.012   |   0.072    |   0.008   |
   |----------------|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
   |     ¬cavity    |   0.016    |   0.064   |   0.144    |   0.576   |
   |----------------|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|

   - P(toothache):
     This is the sum of all probabilities where a toothache occurs, regardless of other conditions:
     P(toothache) = P(cavity, catch, toothache) + P(¬cavity, catch, toothache) + P(cavity, ¬catch, toothache) +
     P(¬cavity, ¬catch, toothache) = 0.108 + 0.016 + 0.012 + 0.064 = 0.2

   - P(cavity):
     This is the sum of all probabilities where a cavity occurs, regardless of other conditions:
     P(cavity) = P(cavity, catch, toothache) + P(cavity, ¬catch, toothache) + P(cavity, catch, ¬toothache) +
     P(cavity, ¬catch, ¬toothache) = 0.108 + 0.012 + 0.072 + 0.008 = 0.2

   - P(toothache∧cavity):
     This is the sum of probabilities where both toothache and cavity occur:
     P(toothache ∧ cavity) = P(cavity, catch, toothache) + P(cavity, ¬catch, toothache) = 0.108 + 0.012 = 0.12

   - P(toothache∨cavity):
     This includes cases where either condition or both occur, corrected for the overlap by subtracting the probability of both occurring:
     P(toothache ∨ cavity) = P(toothache) + P(cavity) - P(toothache ∧ cavity) = 0.2 + 0.2 - 0.12 = 0.28

   - P(toothache|cavity):
     This is calculated by dividing the probability of both a toothache and cavity by the probability of a cavity:
     P(toothache | cavity) = P(toothache ∧ cavity) / P(cavity) = 0.12 / 0.2 = 0.6

   - P(cavity|toothache, catch):
     This is calculated by dividing the probability of all three conditions by the probability of both a toothache and
     catch:
     P(cavity | toothache, catch) = P(cavity, catch, toothache) / (P(cavity, catch, toothache) +
     P(¬cavity, catch, toothache)) = 0.108 / (0.108 + 0.016) = 0.871

   - P(toothache|cavity, catch):
     This is calculated in a similar manner, focusing on the conditions of cavity and catch:
     P(toothache | cavity, catch) = P(cavity, catch, toothache) / (P(cavity, catch, toothache) +
     P(cavity, catch, ¬toothache)) = 0.108 / (0.108 + 0.072) = 0.6

   - Is toothache conditionally independent of catch given cavity? In other words: Does knowing that there is a catch
     have any effect on having toothache, when you that there is cavity? Justify your answer mathematically and describe
     (In a few words) what conditional independence means.

     Conditional Independence:
     For toothache and catch to be conditionally independent given cavity, the probability of toothache given cavity must
     equal the probability of toothache given both cavity and catch. This was shown to be true, as both probabilities
     equaled 0.6, confirming conditional independence. This means knowing whether a catch occurred doesn't change the
     likelihood of a toothache when a cavity is present.
